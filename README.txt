Instant quiz can be also called test or survey. User answers the questions and
receives an instant feedback, without any grades. The best examples are
"Personality tests". For instance, user answers several multichoice questions
and system tells him whether he is introvert, extrovert or a balanced person.

How instant quiz works:

Teacher adds questions and options for answers. Also teacher creates evaluation
criteria. For each answer student gets certain number of points in one or several
criteria. In the end of the test the total number of points for each criterion
is calculated. Student receives a feedback according to the points.

The most common scenario is to have just one criterion and several feedbacks.
For example for each option in a question student will receive 0, 1 or 2 points.
If in the end user scored less than 50% he would get feedback 1, if between
50% and 75% he would get feedback 2, and feedback 3 if above 75%.

Another scenario is to have several criteria and each option in a question
would bring one point towards one of those criteria. In the end if the user has
biggest number of points in the first criterion he receives the first feedback
and so on.

Third scenario is a long psychological test that actually evaluates on 10
different personal traits. In the end user receives 10 feedbacks, one for
each criterion. Each feedback in fact may be just a template that tells
student how much he scored.

There is no integration with gradebook. In fact there may be no correct answers.
Teacher may be able or not to view the individual students answers or the
aggregated data but this is not the main feature.
